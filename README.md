# CUCUMBER PLAYWRIGHT AUTOMATION

## This Project helps us in performing the automation testing of UI using playwright & cucumber-js

- As an automation QA Engineer, this boiler-plate project would definitely helps us in performing the automation testing of UI and efficiently using CucumberJs, playwright and other npm libraries. In addition, since the tests are written using Cucumber, it would help any non-technical users to understand the scenario(s) built.
- This Project was built with a passion to effectively perform quick and efficient way of API tesing.
- This has helped us in solving the quick delivery to production by performing necessary validations on all of the API test(s) to ensure test deliverables are met.
- Open Source has taught many things such as share,learn and improve code through the delivery of this API automation testing.

## Installation

Please run the below commands sequentially from the current/present working directory of the cloned project to download all the dependencies required for the project.

```
npm install
npm run startUpScript
npm run executeShellScript
```

## Usage

We make use of `NODE_ENV` Global variable to execute the tests based on the choice of the environment.

In general, we could categorise environment as below - 
- development(environment used for developmental activities)
- testing(environment used for conducting either `System Testing` OR `System Integration Testing`)
- production(for production activities such as business acceptance testing OR business verification testing)

Whenever we want to run the tests, we use `NODE_ENV` with the value of either `development` OR `testing` OR `production`

For our testing activities, we would make use of `testing`. (i.e, `NODE_ENV=testing`)

```
NODE_ENV=testing npm run cucumber-test
```
Alternatively, we can make use of shell-script to run the tests! 

Hurray!!! Yay!!!

Please execute the below command from either `terminal` or `Iterm`
<Assuming you're on the current/present working directory of the project>

```
./ui-tests/cli/runAcceptanceTest.sh
```

When we run the above command, it would prompt us to select from the displayed choice of list. 

- Select `3` for now to execute the test(i.e, Press the numeric `3` on the keyboard to proceed further and press `enter` or `return` keyword).
- Select the appropriate feature to execute the tests(i.e, Press `1` for now since the `cucumber-tag` used on the feature file is `test`) and press `enter` or `return` keyword.
- It would show us the fully qualified command on the `terminal` followed by running the tests.

Once the tests are run successfully, reports would be generated under `output` directory(i.e, `ui-tests/output/`)

-- An `.html` file automatically pops up in a browser on `Mac` once the above command gets executed.

We have 2 types of `.html` report(s) generated(as mentioned below)

- Cucumber's default html report(i.e, Cucumber generates the default HTML report under the directory(`ui-tests/output`) with the filename  set to `inBuiltReport.html` as specified under our `cucumber.js` config on the root directory of the project.

- Using the npm module `multiple-cucumber-html-reporter` that gives the beautify HTML report under the directory(`ui-tests/output/multiple_cucumber_report/`) with the filename set to `index.html`.(Kudos to its creators: `wswebcreation` for coming up with one of the amazing plugin to show the enriched information of cucumber tests)

Below folder hierarchy is used in building the project.
